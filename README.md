## Description
  The Applied Data Science Master's program at Syracuse University rigorously prepares its students for a future in the field through underlying theories in addition to hands on work. The program introduces students to a variety of data science disciplines and the appropriate tools for each job. In the past eighteen months working through my classes I have gotten exposure to several tools for the first time, such as Access, SQL, Python, R, Idea, and Weka, while honing my skills in more familiar tools like Excel. In addition to working with these tools in the iSchool classes, the dual nature of the degree also has students make sense of data in a business sense through the Whitman School of Management coursework.
  Particular courses such as Data Analytics(IST 707), Big Data Analytics(IST 718), Text Mining(IST 736), and Database Admin Concepts & Management(IST 659) all demonstrated different methods for exploring, analyzing, and explaining data in varying forms and degrees of complexity. The skills learned I in these courses best exemplify the learning objectives for the Applied Data Science degree and have prepared me to look at new information as a Data Scientist.
